Kik-Tech-News (kik-tech-news.herokuapp.com)
============================================

Kik-Tech-News is a mobile web application programmed in Javascript, HTML and CSS. The application is designed to work with the Kik Messenger on iPhone and Android. To add the application as a Kik Card, send a message with the format card://kik-tech-news.herokuapp.com and then tap on the sent message.

The application is a simple RSS Feed Reader that pulls information using the RSS Feeds from The Verge and Engadget. The application is split into two pages, the main list which uses a slide viewer to switch between the two website feeds. Taping on any one article will bring up the Article View which contains a the title, picture and description. You can share ("Kik") the article to your friends.

The application uses node-feedparser (https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser), a node.js to parse RSS feeds.
